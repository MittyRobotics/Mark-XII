LP - Low Priority 
MP - Medium Priority 
HP - Hit points / High Priority 
SORTED IN ORDER OF PRIORITY 



gyroTurn Atom HP - really need to test and debug, pretty bad right now. Need to make it so both wheels properly turn
	Test it with turning various angles - 30, 45, 60, 90 - check for accuracy 
	Check if it goes in the more efficient direction (probs does) 
	Test with bumps - if they affect 
	pid.setContinuous() testing? Look into, TODO
	Test robot on cart on blocks - watch pid.getError() while cart is turned - see if it corrects (PUT ON BLOCKS) 

driveUntilCrate Atom MP/HP - Priority changes based on Vision being completed. Most likely HP. This will autoalign the robot with the crate 
	Place crate directly in front of robot - basic test
	Place crate at some angle in FRONT of robot - slightly harder
	Place crate slightly off - very hard test
	Test how tolerant the robot is to crates in front of it 

cratePlace Atom MP - Should be using existing methods, just drops all held crates onto ground 
	Test 1/2/3 crates - how well it lowers 
	Test with step - does that deter it, or does it continue lowering. Ensure no damage occurs 
	Test with crates in awk positions - meaning only one crate, int lowest set of hooks. Does it continue, or stop? 

goUp Atom MP - Untested, but most likely functioning. Uses existing function calls. 
	Test with one crate, two crates, three crates, four crates
	See if drive or turn atom can be used right after (most likely yes) 
	Test if existing limits are met and kept, or exceeded (probably safe)
	
drive Atom LP - mostly working, need to work out kinks with PID and Incrementer. 
	Test this with basic moving forward, check for accuracy and speed. 
	Test with the bumps and steps on the field - see how that affects
