DRIVE
	Current-based driving
	Position based control for autonomous
	Switching between these modes?
	Driving slower, based on number of crates?
	Shifting

LIFT
	Test crate sensor, pickup totes with crate sensor
	Test trashcan sensor, pickup trashcan automatically with trashcan sensor
	Pickup, dropoff of simple stacks
	Picking up stack with a trashcan - what kind of routine is necessary
	Dropoff stack with a trashcan - what is different
	Resetting the lift; run through typical procedure in pits. How does robot remember stuff after disable/enable
	Middle step - pickup/dropoff
	Test with the whellie bars, check for robot flipping
	Adjust nylon bolts; larger hooks?
	Error recovery - what to do if crate falls off
	Current safety
	Keep track of totes?
	Add tape to trashcan gripper
	Pneumatics
	Test switching to ManualVBUS mode
	TEST GOING FROM MANUALVBUS BACK TO POSITION
	
STATE MACHINE
	Testing everything
	Error recovery - manual mode

AUTONOMOUS
	Driving atoms
	Stacking atoms
	Dropping atoms

VISION
	Vision processing to figure out distance/angle for autonomous
